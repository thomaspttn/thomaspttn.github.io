## about
my name is Thomas Patton, i'm currently a Masters student at Cornell Univeresity studying computer science. prior to that i worked as a machine learning engineer at [Cohere Health](https://coherehealth.com/). 

my primary career interest lies in writing software that makes machine learning accessible to others. as deep learning models become increasingly complex i hope to create APIs that enable others to access these models quickly and easily.
