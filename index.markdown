## about
my name is Thomas Patton, i'm currently a Masters student at Cornell Univeresity studying computer science. prior to that i worked as a machine learning engineer at [Cohere Health](https://coherehealth.com/) and as a software engineering intern at NASA. 

my primary career interest lies in developing scalable ML systems within interesting business contexts. i also love writing clean and concise APIs to help developers take advantage of the benefits ML can offer.

outside of work i enjoy lifting weights, drinking cheap coffee, and practicing piano. if anything i've said sparks your interest don't hesitate to reach out below.
