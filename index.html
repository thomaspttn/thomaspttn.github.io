        <p>hello, my name is Thomas Patton. i'm currently a masters of computer science student at Cornell University where i work in the <a href="https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/">EmPRISELab</a> to incorporate machine learning into assistive feeding robots. after graduation i'm heading to <a href="https://www.modalai.com/">ModalAI</a> to work on computer vision problems in lightweight drones.</p>
        <p> my career interest is probably best defined as the intersection of applied ml and robotics. i'd rather use a model someone else built to solve an interesting challenge than to build the model myself. i've also developed an interest in robots through my graduate education. i love the difficult and unique challenges that come with implementing algorithms into sensitive real-world systems.</p>
        <p>outside of work i enjoy lifting weights, drinking cheap coffee, and playing piano.</p>
